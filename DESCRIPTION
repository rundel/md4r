Description: Provides an R wrapper for the 'MD4C' (Markdown for 'C')
    library.  Functions exist for parsing markdown ('CommonMark'
    compliant) along with support for other common markdown extensions
    (e.g. 'GitHub' flavored markdown, 'LaTeX' equation support, etc.). The
    package also provides a number of higher level functions for exploring
    and manipulating markdown abstract syntax trees as well as translating
    and displaying the documents.
